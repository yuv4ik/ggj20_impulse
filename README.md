# Impulse

Impulse is a game about understanding and trying to overcome different phobias. Phobias are experienced in a 3D environment, where multiple physical options are offered to Player that will lead him further. If the correct option is chosen it will lead the Player to a small 2D mini-game where he has to cure damaged nerve connections by bringing them the randomly spawned impulses.
